## Project Introduction



[superduper](https://github.com/superduper-io/superduper)  is an AI application development and database integration platform for developers and enterprises, which can simplify the interaction between AI models and various databases such as Qdrant and MySQL. Aim to lower the threshold for AI application implementation, provide a modular and scalable toolchain, and help quickly achieve scenarios such as enhanced generation of RAG retrieval and intelligent question answering. This product provides an out-of-the-box superduper based on the Huawei Cloud EulerOS 2.0 64-bit system of Kunpeng servers.

## Core Features

- **Seamless integration of AI models and databases:** Support the direct insertion of AI models such as big language models, embedding models, classifiers, etc. into existing databases (such as MongoDB, SQLite) to achieve automatic data expansion and intelligent enhancement
- **Dynamic Vector Storage and Retrieval:** Automatically call the model to generate embedding vectors and store them during data writing, with out of box support for semantic search, similarity matching, and vectorized queries, without the need to build additional synchronization pipelines
